### **_Description_**

#### What do you consider the "Good Life"? The "Good Life" to us is living a balanced lifestyle with daily goals. Somedays we have good days and some are far more worst than others. It doesn't matter if you're a full time working mom or a college student, we all need balance. That is why I present to you the "Manifestation" app where you can keep plan the day and manifest the life you deserve.
