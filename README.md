### **_Description_**

#### What do you consider the "Good Life"? The "Good Life" to us is living a healthier lifestyle with daily habits to match it. Somedays we have good days and some are far more worst than others. It doesn't matter if you're a full time working mom or a college student, we all need balance. That is why I present to you the "Healthy Habits" app where you can keep track of your day-to-day habits.
